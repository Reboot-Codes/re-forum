# ReForum

Open source and federated forum software.

ReForum (like other bits of forum software) allows for the creation of a community of users which can post threads that have replies. ReForum is unique in it's ability to communicate with other instances of ReForum. This creates a sort of federated network (like Mastodon) via [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub). You can think of ReForum as a Fediverse alternative to Reddit where each ReForum instance would be a sub-reddit.
